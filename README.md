A very basic blog built using Nextjs and Strapi headless CMS framework for backend management. I wasn't able to host the demo on a free hosting provider since the strapi and the nextjs are large to be hosted for free. You can still clone the project though :p

Features:

- User registeration using Strapi api
- User authentication using strapi locale methods(+JWT)
- Ability to add posts with categories and images
- nextjs server side rendering
- responsive

Conclusion: Strapi is cool to use for a quick API construction. I also liked the part in which user registration is done just by calling the api and strapi handles the rest. Overall it's good.
